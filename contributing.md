Thanks for deciding to contribute to here! However, before contributing, make sure to follow the below rules.
1) Please label everything that is specific to something (Ubuntu version, hardware, etc)
2) If the code has links, please save it and link to the archive using https://web.archive.org/
This is so that if a page ever gets deleted, people can still get help from this.
3) Credit articles you find some fixes on. They might have more help than the code you provide with fixes in English rather in code.
4) Do not have any illegal or malicious content in your code. This includes, but is not limited to, malware, spyware, or anything encouraging illegal activity.
